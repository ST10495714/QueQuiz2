1PURPOSE OF THE APP
The purpose of the application is for the user to be able to learn on the app. There will be several questions or statements in the app, and you will be given the chance to give the correct answer to the question and or answer true or false to the given statement. Then after you have completed the number of questions you will be given your score and then right after you will be able to review your correct and wrong answers. This will help you know what you have answered wrong and why your answer is wrong if applicable.
2DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
SIMPLICITY: The app will be a simple to use android app, that will be in a very easy to understand manner. You can easily use the app with one hand which is the right hand. It has instructions in case you do not know what do or else get lost during the experience.
CONSISTENCY: With this one it would be the type of font, font size, buttons throughout the app, typography, colour palettes and most importantly the layout of the whole app completely. I had used a large font size so that users will be able to see what has been written, on the writing and on the buttons, the whole app contains black coloured font. The buttons are placed either parallel or vertical to each other.
READABILITY: The app has a simple to understand language and typography it has large and bold font that is readable but it the background may be too bright for the text. Throughout the whole app you will be able to get instructions that are easy to understand so you won’t misunderstand what to do but know exactly what to do. I used this in the buttons, instructions, questions and the answers of the questions and finally the score so that you can see and read completely what you got wrong and right.
FEEDBACK: During the designing process of my app, I had people look at it so that they can give me their intake on my applications design, and I got very impressive feedback from them. I had a completely different design on my app and after taking in the feedback and suggestions, I eventually changed the overview and positioning of the buttons and the layout so that it can a company every user. I also changed some of the questions as they also gave feedback about them.
PLACEMENT: This is how everything in the app is placed and that it is applicable to use to use with on hand. How the design of the app is and importantly the overview of the app. I used this consideration with how I placed the buttons and the text of each instruction and question, thus this will make it easier for the user to use the app whether with both hands or with one hand.
